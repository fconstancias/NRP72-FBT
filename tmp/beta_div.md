#### Load required packages


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(phyloseq)
library(speedyseq)
library(ggrepel)
library(ampvis2)
library(plotly)
library(microbiome)
options(getClass.msg=FALSE) # https://github.com/epurdom/clusterExperiment/issues/66
#this fixes an error message that pops up because the class 'Annotated' is defined in two different packages
```

#### Load functions from Github


```r
'%!in%' <- function(x,y)!('%in%'(x,y))

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fconstancias/DivComAnalyses/master/R/phyloseq_taxa_tests.R")
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fconstancias/DivComAnalyses/master/R/phyloseq_normalisation.R")

## Loading required package: scales

## The following object is masked from 'package:microbiome':

```


#### Load physeq object



```r
ps = "data/processed/physeq_update_23_11.RDS"

ps %>% 
  here::here() %>%
  readRDS() %>%
  phyloseq_get_strains_fast() %>%
  phyloseq_remove_chloro_mitho() -> physeq
```

```
## Joining, by = "ASV"
```

```r
physeq %>% 
  subset_samples(Experiment == "Continuous") %>% 
  subset_samples(Paul %!in% c("Paul")) %>%
  subset_samples(Reactor != "IR2") -> ps_PolyFermS
```

We will be analysing only the PolyFermS samples here so take a subset of the physeq object.  

```r
physeq %>% 
  subset_samples(Experiment == "Continuous") %>% 
  subset_samples(Paul %!in% c("Paul")) %>%
  subset_samples(Reactor != "IR2") -> ps_polyFermS

sample_data(ps_polyFermS)$Reactor <- fct_relevel(sample_data(ps_polyFermS)$Reactor, "IR1", "CR", "TR1", "TR2","TR3", "TR4", "TR5", "TR6") 

sample_data(ps_polyFermS)$Treatment <- fct_relevel(sample_data(ps_polyFermS)$Treatment, "UNTREATED",  "CTX+HV292.1", "CTX","HV292.1","VAN+CCUG59168", "VAN",  "CCUG59168") 

sample_data(ps_polyFermS)$Reactor_Treatment <- fct_relevel(sample_data(ps_polyFermS)$Reactor_Treatment, "IR1_UNTREATED","CR_UNTREATED", "CR_CTX", "CR_VAN", "TR1_CTX+HV292.1","TR2_CTX", "TR3_HV292.1", "TR5_VAN+CCUG59168", "TR4_VAN", "TR6_CCUG59168") 

ps_polyFermS %>% 
  rarefy_even_depth(sample.size = 4576,
                    rngseed = 123) -> ps_polyFermS_rare
```

```
## `set.seed(123)` was used to initialize repeatable random subsampling.
```

```
## Please record this for your records so others can reproduce.
```

```
## Try `set.seed(123); .Random.seed` for the full vector
```

```
## ...
```

```
## 16 samples removedbecause they contained fewer reads than `sample.size`.
```

```
## Up to first five removed samples are:
```

```
## CR-40-S166ETR1-30-S178ETR1-42-S194ETR2-30-S195IR1-40-S197
```

```
## ...
```

```
## 50OTUs were removed because they are no longer 
## present in any sample after random subsampling
```

```
## ...
```

Compute beta-div metrics:


```r
ps_polyFermS_rare %>%
  phyloseq_compute_bdiv(norm = "pc",
                        phylo = TRUE,
                        seed = 123) -> bdiv_list
```

Visualize distance 'trajectories' :

We will use the library use dist to get it in the dataframe we want for plotting [useDist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/usedist/readme/README.html)

```r
ps = coda$physeq_clr

ps %>% 
  otu_table() %>%
  vegan::vegdist(method = "eucl") -> mtest

mtest %>%
  usedist::dist_groups(ps %>% get_variable("Reactor_Treatment")) -> dist_df

ps %>% 
    sample_data() %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    rownames_to_column('tmpid') %>%
    dplyr::select(tmpid, Day_from_Inoculum) -> meta_df
```


```r
left_join(
  dist_df,
  meta_df %>%
    dplyr::rename("varGroup1" = Day_from_Inoculum),
  by = c("Item1" = "tmpid")) %>%
  left_join(
    meta_df %>%
    dplyr::rename("varGroup2" = Day_from_Inoculum),

```

Please carefully check if the code makes sense
