Split drug classes containing multiple agents into separate drug classes. For example the drug class "cephalosporin; penam" should be split into "cephalosporin" and "penam" and genes coming under "cephalosporin; penam" should appear both in drug.class "cephalosporin" and "penam". 


```r
plot.df.sep <- separate_rows(plot.df, Drug.Class,sep = '; ',convert = TRUE)
```

Just in case we need abbreviations for drug class labels. 



Make the heatmap. 

```r
#convert drug class ino factors
plot.df.sep$Drug.Class <- factor(plot.df.sep$Drug.Class
                             #, labels = drug_class_labels
                             )


plot.df.sep %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Day_of_Treatment,
                       y = Best_Hit_ARO ,
                       fill = TPM,
  )) +
  # facet_grid(. ~ Reactor_Treatment,  scales = "free", space = "free", drop = TRUE) +
  facet_grid(Drug.Class ~ Reactor_Treatment, scales = "free", space = "free", drop = TRUE,labeller = labeller(Drug.Class = label_wrap_gen(width = 15))) +
  #we adjust the vertical labels such that it is printed correctly. 
  geom_tile() +
